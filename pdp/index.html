            <h1>Where did I come from?</h1>
            <p>
              I come from a background that combines traditional and digital
              creativity. I have experience in painting, especially oil, where I
              focus on figurative work with classical techniques but also a
              contemporary touch. I also explore tattooing as a way to maintain
              artistic discipline and expand my skills. My greatest influences
              have always been classical painters, Pre-Raphaelites, cinema,
              music, and books. In addition, I have worked in design which gave
              me tools for visual communication and organization. These have
              shaped how I approach both art and creative processes.

            <h1>What do I want to improve the coming weeks?</h1>
            <p>
              I deeply respect classical painting, and oil painting remains one
              of my great passions, as it has trained me in a technique that
              demands patience, precision, and detail. However, I am here
              because I want to open my mind to new forms of creation and
              explore other processes. I am interested in approaching faster,
              rougher, more intuitive, imperfect and colourful dynamics, where
              it is not essential to start from a well-defined base drawing, but
              simply to let myself be carried away by the act of creating. I
              have begun to experiment with oil pastels, markers and airbrushes.
              Of course, I want to continue to delve deeper into oil painting
              and realism, but at the same time I want to broaden my practice,
              discover freer languages and, perhaps, find ways to combine both
              dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also want to explore more about the international art world,
              expanding my references and understanding different contemporary
              practices. Additionally, I want to work on my mindset, being less
              self-critical and more open to experimentation, while learning how
              to balance art, work, and personal growth.

            <ul>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Dedicate fixed daily time slots to create, and sketching ideas
                  for my series.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Research and analyze small-scale figurative painters and how
                  they handle intimacy and symbolism.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Visit at least one exhibition in the coming weeks and reflect
                  on how it connects to my own practice.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Use sketchbooks as a tool for experimentation without
                  pressure—drawing, writing, and exploring compositions freely.
                </li>
              </p>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Reflection exercises to regulate self-criticism and stay
                  connected to my goals.
                </li>
              </p>
            </ul>
            <p>
             <p> Also, when I'm stuck, I use a method of asking myself questions to
              get things moving again and get back to creating. I'll share them
              with you :) </p>• What emotion do I want to convey with this painting?
              • Do I want to tell a story, express something personal, or simply
              experiment with technique? • If I had to choose one word to sum up
              the idea behind the painting, what would it be? • Is there a
              recent experience or recurring thought that I want to capture? •
              Do I prefer to work with human figures, objects, landscapes, or
              something more abstract?  • Which format inspires me
              most: vertical, horizontal, or square? • Do I want a minimalist
              approach or one full of details? • Where do I want the focus of
              the work to be? • What feeling do I want to create: calm, tension,
              movement, silence...? • Do I want to
              experiment with something new or reinforce my classic style? •
              What kind of light appeals to me for this painting: dramatic,
              soft, cold, warm? • Am I interested in working with a limited
              palette or with many colours? • Do I want to use only oil or
              integrate other techniques such as charcoal, ink or airbrush?
